    "text": "I am Juan Sebastián Felipe Olmos Núñez. I’m an anthropologist who finds new ways to search for answers through Complexity Science—my second love. My main interest lies in understanding how we, as humans, transform, and are transformed by, our environment. This curiosity has led me to study different socioecological systems (from present to past!) from different perspectives.\nIn my research, I have asked lots of questions! Some of these include: Which social and environmental factors are related to plant diversity? and how does social complexity evolve over time under environmental pressures? To explore these and other questions, I ground my work in evolutionary anthropology and, thus, I combine mathematical modeling tools with ethnographic approaches.\nAdditional, relevant, and fundamental information: My team is Santa fe 🔴⚪, I like changua 🍵, dogs 🐕, pokemon 🐦‍🔥, and music 𝄞."
