## About me!

I am Juan Sebastián Felipe Olmos Núñez. I’m an anthropologist who finds new ways to search for answers through **Complexity Science**—my second love. My main interest lies in understanding how we, as humans, transform, and are transformed by, our environment. This curiosity has led me to study different **socioecological systems** (from present to past!) from different perspectives.

In my research, I have asked lots of questions! Some of these include: Which social and environmental factors are related to plant diversity? and how does social complexity evolve over time under environmental pressures? To explore these and other questions, I ground my work in **evolutionary anthropology** and, thus, I combine mathematical modeling tools with ethnographic approaches.

Additional, relevant, and fundamental information: My team is Santa fe 🔴⚪, I like changua 🍵, dogs 🐕, pokemon 🐦‍🔥, and music 𝄞.
